FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CallGuardian Launches AI-Powered Call and Message Protection App for Android

New privacy-focused app uses artificial intelligence to identify and block spam calls and messages

[CITY, DATE] – CallGuardian today announced the launch of its AI-powered call and message protection app for Android devices. The app combines advanced machine learning with traditional caller identification to provide comprehensive protection against spam, scams, and unwanted communications.

Unlike traditional call blocking apps that rely solely on user-reported databases, CallGuardian uses artificial intelligence to analyze call patterns and assess risk in real-time. The app's unique privacy-first design ensures that all user data remains on the device, never uploading call logs or messages to external servers.

"We built CallGuardian because we were frustrated with the lack of truly private call protection apps," said [Founder Name]. "Users shouldn't have to sacrifice their privacy to block spam calls."

Key features include:
• AI-powered spam probability scoring
• Multiple reverse lookup data sources
• One-tap blocking from notifications
• Complete local data storage
• Battery-efficient background operation

CallGuardian is available free on the Google Play Store and requires Android 10 or later.
